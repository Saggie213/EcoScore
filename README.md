## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 📊 ML Models

The backend includes four trained models:

### 1. Carbon Footprint Calculator
- **Model**: Gradient Boosting Regressor
- **Features**: Purchases, distance, packaging, electricity, travel
- **Output**: CO₂ emissions in kg

### 2. ESG Scoring
- **Model**: Gradient Boosting with TF-IDF
- **Features**: Product description, sentiment, environmental score
- **Output**: ESG score (0-100)

### 3. Packaging Suggestions
- **Model**: Gradient Boosting Classifier
- **Features**: Material type, weight, fragility, transport mode
- **Output**: Optimal packaging recommendation

### 4. Product Recommendations
- **Model**: Gradient Boosting with feature engineering
- **Features**: Category, price, rating, sustainability metrics
- **Output**: Purchase likelihood and recommendations
